<b>About :</b>
<p>Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral.It is performed to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback and understand customer needs. I have used Instant Data Scrapper Tool for extracting data for analysis using Hadoop and BeautifulSoup Library.<br></p>
<p> My extracted data consists of information regarding Product name, Product ratings, Total product reviews, stars, current price and discount offered on product.
Here, BeautifulSoup library is used to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parce tree from page source code that can be used to extract data in readable manner. </p>
<p> Further, Hadoop is used for our data analysis as it is an open-source framework, and it works efficiently on large datasets ranging from size gigabytes to petabytes. Also, Hadoop allows clustering multiple computers to analyse massive datasets in parallel.
The main objective to use sentimental analysis is to analyse people’s perspective regarding purchase of the product which can result in business strategies in a way. Moreover, business analysts can gain useful insights over different products.</p>
